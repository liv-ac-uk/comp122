## Newtons Method

In `Newton.java`, implement [Newton's method](https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Newton's_method#/Square_root_of_a_number) in the given function `sqRoot()` to give an approximation of the square root of an inputted value of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n).

This algorithm (also called the "Babylonian method"), approximates ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D) by iteratively improving a ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?guess) for the square root according to the formula:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?new%5C%20guess%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%28n%20/%20guess%29%20&plus;%20guess%7D%7B2%7D)

Until the last two values differ by at most, a given precision ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon).

For example, suppose you want to approximate ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D) up to error ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon%3D0.0000001). If our initial guess is ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1) , the sequence of guesses would be:

```
1.0
1.5
1.4166666666666665
1.4142156862745097
1.4142135623746899
1.414213562373095
```

These last two numbers differ by less than ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon), so the sequence of guesses stops with the final number as the estimate of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D)​​. By taking ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon) to be smaller, one can get a better estimate of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D). Of course, this has limits based on the number of decimal places that the computer can store internally.

## Newtons Method
Your code will take in two positive numbers as commandline arguments ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?guess). It should calculate an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon)-approximation of the square root of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n), when ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cepsilon%3D0.0000001).

Your function should print the total number of guesses taken (including the initial guess), and the square root of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n).

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

You may want to use a `while` loop to compute ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?new%5C%20guess) and compare it to your previous guess. You can use the function Math.abs() when testing the difference between successive guesses.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

You can access your command line arguments after calling `main(String[] args)` with `args[0]`, `args[1]` etc.

You can convert these to doubles with `Double.parseDouble(string);`

## Extending Your Program

When calculating the square root, we may want to specify how many decimal places of accuracy we should compute our final answer to. 

Modify your program so that it may *also* take in three floats. It will then call a method to compute the square root to the specified number of decimal places, and print the number of iterations and final value as before. 

Make sure that your program still works if we only input two numbers.

```console
$> java Newton 2 1 0.0001
5
1.4142135623746899
```

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

You can check the number of commandline arguments given with `args.length`

## Helping the user
What happens if someone doesn't enter two parameters? They may get a nasty exception... 

Edit your code so that if the user enters fewer than 2, or more than 3 parameters it will print the following message

```console
$> java Newton 
Incorrect Number of Parameters
Usage: java Newton number guess epsilon
```
